I'm happy to announce version 2.6.2 of [eclipselink-maven-plugin](http://github.com/ethlo/eclipselink-maven-plugin) released!

###New features
* Support for [JPA 2.1 features](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/What_is_new_in_JPA_2.1%3F) and `@Convert` converter - Thanks [Lukáš Vasek](https://github.com/bilak).
* Simple [test project now available](https://github.com/ethlo/eclipselink-maven-plugin-test). Useful as example, testing and getting started use.

###Internal changes 
Update to latest annotation configured Maven plugin model getting rid of deprecated Maven features.

Let me know how it works!
